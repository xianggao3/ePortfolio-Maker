                <h2>About Eric Cartman</h2>
                <p>"Eric Theodore Cartman, usually referred to as just Cartman, is one of the main characters, along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski,
                    and Kenny McCormick. Cartman is sometimes the main antagonist of an episode. None of the other three main children consider 
                    Cartman their friend and do not know why they started hanging out with him in the first place, however, he is usually Kyle's first
                    choice when he breaks his friendship with Stan. In earlier episodes, Kenny was his best friend, however, in later seasons, Butters
                    Stotch is usually depicted as such."</p>
