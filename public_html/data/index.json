None of the other three main children consider Cartman their friend and do not know why they started hanging out with him in the first place, however, he is usually Kyle's first choice when he breaks his friendship with Stan. In earlier episodes, Kenny was his best friend, however, in later seasons, <a href='http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Butters_Stotch'>Butters Stotch</a> is usually depicted as such."}
